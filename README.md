# ABM-CTM-MD
Here you can find the ABM I built to answer the research question of my bachelor's thesis: Assessing Theoretical Bases For Implementing Animal Species Conservation Measures In Fragmented Rainforests: An ABM Approach. The jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of the results and validation are available for download as well. Please contact me if you want to do anything with any of the documents: julian.el-fasih@student.uva.nl.
